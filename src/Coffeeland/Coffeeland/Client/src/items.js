      description:
        "A smooth light roasted dynamic powerhouse. No bitterness or aftertaste on this gem. We use portions of both our Brazil and Costa Rica for this coffee. Costa Rican coffees set the standard for washed (wet processed) bright Central American coffees in both the bean and at the mill. Costa Rican coffees are exceptionally high grown in amazing volcanic soil. These two factors come together to produce a very bright and very clean cup. The best Costas are the cups that develop a bit of berry fruitiness to compliment the straight-out brightness. Costa Rican coffees serve as an excellent bright single origin coffee and will definitely add life to various blends. Additionally, these slower grown, dense, high altitude beans can take the heat of a French roast."

      type: "Blends",
      description:
        "Scandinavians – Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, and Finns – all love coffee. Our Scandinavian blend coffee will invoke images of warm, rustic cottages set against the mountains and lakes of Scandinavia; elk and moose range the countryside while families sit around a log fire. We have chosen to mix highly graded Mexican and Brazilian beans in equal portions to create the warmth this blend requires. Our Mexican Chiapas SHG coffee originates in the southern Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. Volcanic soil helps the coffee to grow very well, and it contributes a certain brightness to the coffee. The coffee beans are also SHG – strictly high grown – which is the highest grade given to coffee in Mexico."

      description:
        "Coffee holds a special place in Ethiopian culture that transcends that of the coffees from other origin countries. The majority of the crop does not even leave the country and is drunk with great ceremony by the Ethiopian people. This is in contrast to other origins where coffee is a cash crop, with the best being exported, and the dregs kept locally and drunk unceremoniously with plenty of milk and sugar to choke it down."
